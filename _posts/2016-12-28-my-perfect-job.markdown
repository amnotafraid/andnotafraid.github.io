If I found the perfect job, what would that look like?  How would I contribute to the organization that hired me?  Let me dream ...

I work for a company that has very useful and profitable products&#8212;ideally SaaS.  This company has a growth path outlined that depends on high-quality, well-documented code.

I work from home on a Mac.  I muck about with the data and write APIs supported by well-tested queries.  I write very clear and understandable documentation for these APIs and publish it on a Jekyll site using markdown.  I have access to the company's AWS account, and I work with DevOps&#8212;gradually improving and automating the deployment of applications.  I write easily understood documentation for the DevOps.  I have *lots* of work to do.

I work when I'm most productive, which may not be from 9 to 5.  When I have a creative block, I take a break.  When I've got a good idea and the code is just flowing out of my pores, I work all night.

Because I write APIs and do DevOps, the 'consumers' of my work are fellow developers.  Usually, they are able to follow my documentation and accomplish what they need.  However, when they need help, they set an appointment with me, and we screen share to solve problems together.

Because I know the growth plan of the company, I have the ability  to set my own priorities and be self-managing.  I meet weekly with my supervisor(s) to give progress reports, get direction, and excitedly explain new ideas that I have.

I am a valuable asset to the company because I am reliable, have good ideas, and do high-quality work.  The reason I can be valuable is because I am encouraged to do things right.
