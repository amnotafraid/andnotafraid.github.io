SSH keys are a way for a local machine to connect securely to a remote machine.  The keys ccome in pairs -- a private key and a public key.  The private key is kept on the local machine and the public key is given to the remote machine to which the user wants to connect.

SSH keys are used with git to securely transfer code.

# Create SSH [top](#top)

This is how to do it on OSX.  Likely, you should be in the ~/.ssh directory. If you do it in another directory, you can just move them to the ~/.ssh directory later:

```
ssh-keygen
```
It will prompt you to enter a file name.  This will be the name of the keypair.  It will also prompt to enter a 'passphrase'.  This is a password on the ssh key itself.  Unless you really need to, you can leave it blank.  If you enter one and forget it, you'll have to start all over.

It will make some squiggles on the screen that look like this:
![sha squiggles]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/sha-squiggles.png)

To copy this key to the pastebin, you can use this little trick (assuming you named the key `first`):
```
cat ~/.ssh/first.pub | pbcopy
```
Afterwards, you can insert it where you want it by using CMD-v.

# Add to Github [top](#top)

To use the key with github, log in to your github account and add the key:
```
Profile > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key
```
Enter a title the same as the name of the ssh key.  Paste the key into the Key field and click "Add SSH key".

| ssh -v | This will tell you if ssh is installed |
| ls -a ~/.ssh | Lists ssh keys |
| ssh-keygen | Generates an ssh key (enter a passphrase and remember it |
| ps -e &#124; grep ssh&#45;agent | Checks is ssh-agent is running.  If it is, you will get a process key |
| ssh-add -l | Check to see if your key is added.  If it says ‘The agent has no identities’, you need to add your key |
| cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | Places contents of id_rsa in pastebin |
