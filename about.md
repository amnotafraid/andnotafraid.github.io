These are the topics that I plan to write about in this blog:

* git
* JavaScript
* Grunt
* AngularJS
* Mongo and Mongoose
* Node

It would be cool if I had a description of what a full stack developer does with a graphic showing the different areas of the full stack.

Oo!  And what about a resume?  And samples of code?

For today, I would be happy to get this out to github.
