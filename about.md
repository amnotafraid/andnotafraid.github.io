My name is **Bessie Malek**.  I live and code in **Dallas, TX**, but I'm originally from Illinois.  Not the Chicago part.  The other part where they grow corn.

I build web and database applications.  I like the ability to organize data and to make something useful.  I have developed applications from the ground up using PHP and MySQL.  Recently, I built an application using Node.js and Mongo and Angular, and I really liked the challenge.  I hope that I have an opportunity to do more with this technology.
